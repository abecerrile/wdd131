                <h1>A NOTE FROM OUR FOUNDER</h1>
                <p>My journey towards healthier skin inspired me to develop products that really work, in a way that's
                    accessible to everyone. cloudy is dedicated to making products based in science and great
                    formulation,
                    simplifying many of the mysteries and complex narratives behind efficacious skincare. I hope these
                    will
                    become your go-to essentials that can live in your bathroom, be your favorite travel companion,
                    improve
                    your skin over time, and keep your skin happy and hydrated.</p>
