        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> 
            I am from Mexico City, Mexico. I served my mission in Aguascalientes, Mexico. After completing my mission, I recognized the importance of obtaining a high-quality education. Even though I was attending one of the top colleges in Latin America, I knew that BYU-I would be the best place for me to further develop my abilities. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Development with a specialization in the information technology field. I believe that the Lord has a plan for each of us, and I felt that this could be a great opportunity to better serve His children in the future. As part of my goals, I am working towards obtaining a Master's degree in Software Engineering at BYU-Idaho.
            I have a particular interest in neuroscience books, as they illuminate the incredible potential of the human brain. In terms of music, I have a deep affection for alternative rock, with my favorite band being The Killers. Additionally, I am dedicated to expanding my language skills beyond English and am currently learning Portuguese and French. I find languages to be fascinating, as they not only broaden one's knowledge but also provide the opportunity to connect with people from diverse backgrounds and perspectives.
            Lastly, I'm happily married to my beatiful wife Julissa, and I also enjoy spending time with her.
